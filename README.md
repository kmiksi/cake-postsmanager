CakePHP Posts Manager
=====================

A simple timeline-based posts management system
-----------------------------------------------

This is a simple app to manage blog posts, using a timeline to show simple posts.

It uses CakePHP for backend and AdminLTE bootstrap theme for layout.

For this project I used TurnKey apliance as development environment.
